Welcome to the comma.ai Programming Challenge!
======

Your goal is to predict the speed of a car from a video.

- data/train.mp4 is a video of driving containing 20400 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
- data/train.txt contains the speed of the car at each frame, one speed on each line.
- data/test.mp4 is a different driving video containing 10798 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.

Deliverable
-----

Your deliverable is test.txt. E-mail it to givemeajob@comma.ai, or if you think you did particularly well, e-mail it to George.

Evaluation
-----

We will evaluate your test.txt using mean squared error. <10 is good. <5 is better. <3 is heart.

Ideas
------

- The simples logic is to directly feed the data to NN, and let it understand the relation between frame and speed.
 - A good feature to predict speed from is through the objects on the sides of the car, and not directly in front of it.
